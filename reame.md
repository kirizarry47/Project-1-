Overview/description of the project: FoodExpress will eventually become a landing page for an application that provides a meal prep service. I purchased the content for the site from Udemy. The page will eventually function as a selling point to potential customers interested in both downloading the application or purchasing the meal service. The page will be a single html page.



Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered: The page has a navagation bar which leads to 3 seperate html pages. The cities.html page has an image carousel which will scroll though the various cities FoodExpress is available in. The signup.html page has a button that links to the forms.html page.



Technologies Used ( .html , .css ): The technologies i attempted to use was HTML, CSS and BootStrap.



Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3): In the near future I would like to create a more flexible grid to bring not only responsiveness but more consistancy to the page. I plan on putting all of the content of the on a single html page with one css styling sheet. I would like to perfect the design and layout of the page so that I can showcase to a potential client who is starting his own meal prep service. I would also like to gain to a deeper understanding of bootstrap so I can perfect the layout of the design.
